# Command Line and Unix Introduction



Programming requires a number of tools and knowledge that aren&#39;t obvious when you start learning a language like Python.  All the online books won&#39;t help you if you don&#39;t get your environment set up and well understood in the long term.

To write and run programs on your machine (not in a Jupyter notebook) you will need a &quot;plain text&quot; editor.  This means a tool for text that does not do formatting like Word does.

- On Windows, you can use Notepad or Notepad++.  You might eventually want a real programming tool but Notepad++ will get you pretty far.

- On Mac, you should download Sublime Text 2 or 3 (you can use the trial) or Atom.



**Terminal Windows/Shell CMD Window**



You need to know your way around your file system and the terminal window because these will come up pretty quickly.  Understanding the file system is #1 priority, because you can&#39;t do anything in code (including web html/css) without being able to understand file paths.

Open a Terminal window on Mac. In Launchpad, search for &quot;Terminal.&quot;

Try typing &quot;ls&quot; and then &quot;return&quot; and see what you get.  You&#39;re on your way.

Open a command prompt on Windows. Click on search , type &quot;CMD.&quot;

Try typing &quot;dir&quot;,this command will display all the files and folders in the current directory, and then type &quot;cls&quot; and see what happens.

On Windows, install the linux bash shell if on Windows 10 (e.g., [https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)) or win-bash ( [http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/](http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/)) or Cygwin (last resort, much larger to install).

This window is different than the CMD window on windows, because it has a smarter command system that understand some Unix.  Try typing &quot;ls&quot; here too.
